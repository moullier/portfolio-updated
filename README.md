# Portfolio - Updated

## Description

This project is the latest version of my portfolio website, consisting of three HTML files and a CSS file for styling.  It is responsive to the size of the browser viewing the site, so when it is viewed on a smaller screen such as a phone, the information displayed will adjust.  At this time, the projects page displays screenshots and links to our first group project assignement, and two homework assignments that demonstrate my increasing Javascript experience.  The Contact page contains contact information, a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts, and a link to my resume.

The primary CSS framework used in designing this site is Bootstrap.  The site is laid out using the Bootstrap grid, which makes it simple to lay out pages using rows and columns, and makes it possible to change the layout on the fly for different browser window sizes.  Bootstrap also contains some pre-formatted components such as cards, and I used some of these as well.

## Credits

In developing this portfolio, I used the Bootstrap Documentation on the grid, found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/layout/grid/.
